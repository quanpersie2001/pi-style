# ADR 0007: Turn tool summaries

- Status: **Accepted**
- Date: 2026-08-08

## Context

After an agent turn finishes, the feed is dominated by completed tool blocks (read/ls/find/grep/bash/edit/write), each a box or tree panel. The user must scroll through tall completed output to reach the assistant's final answer — output that was already consumed while it streamed.

pi-style already implements the exact mechanism this feature needs, for consecutive quiet tools (read/ls/find) in `features/tools/boxed/batch.ts`:

1. the first call of a batch becomes its **leader**: the leader's call component renders the whole boxless panel (header + tree), reading live batch state on every render pass;
2. subsequent members render **zero lines** (`hideBatchMember`), so they consume no vertical space;
3. **errors stay visible**: failed members always render inline, even in the collapsed state.

"Collapse a finished turn to one line" is the same pattern generalized from batch granularity to whole-turn granularity.

Two facts verified against Pi 0.84.0 shape the contract:

- **Pi owns the tool-expansion state.** `app.tools.expand` (Ctrl+O, internally `app.ln`, default binding) toggles `setExpanded()` on every expandable feed child (`interactive-mode.js` `setToolsExpanded`); `ToolExecutionComponent` carries a per-block `expanded` field (default `false`) delivered to result renderers as `options.expanded`. pi-style's boxed renderers already consume it (`bash.ts` renders a tail preview plus a `Ctrl+O for more` footer when collapsed).
- **`pi.registerShortcut` exists as a public API, but there is no per-block focus model.** A shortcut handler cannot know which feed block the user means, so per-turn expansion would have to target "the last collapsed turn" — a new keybinding surface with binding-ownership and conflict policy implications, for no demonstrated need in v1.

## Decision

After the agent run completes (user request → `agent_end`), collapse that run's **finalized** tool blocks into a single summary line. Pi emits `turn_end` per assistant message, so every tool batch of the request appends to the same summary group and collapses together. The only expand gesture in v1 is Pi's existing global tool-output toggle (Ctrl+O); no new keybinding, no new Pi-core patch identity, no new compatibility surface.

### Renderer contract

```ts
showSummary(call) =
  turnEnded(call.toolCallId) &&            // derived from session content, not runtime flags
  !options.expanded &&                     // Pi's global tool-output state (read-only)
  config.tools.collapseAfterTurn === "on";
```

- **Leader** = the first tool item of the turn. It renders the summary line; every other tool item of the turn renders zero lines (the existing batch-member pattern).
- **Summary format**: `➔ Read 2 files, ran 4 shell commands · 3.1s` — per-tool-type counts (existing `pluralForm`), total elapsed from the wall-clock state registry, truncated via `safeTruncateToWidth`; Nerd/Unicode/ASCII variants follow the glyph-mode config. The summary replaces the batch panel header too (a turn of only quiet tools collapses from one tree panel to one line).
- **Never collapsed**: error results (`isError`), partial/pending blocks (`isPartial`), turns that did not complete (interrupted by Esc or session end), and the currently running turn. Error blocks remain visible below the summary line; the summary may carry a `· 1 failed` marker pointing at them.
- **`user_bash` (`!command`) blocks are `BashExecutionComponent` items**, not tool calls of the agent turn — never summarized.
- **Expansion override**: when `options.expanded` is true (Ctrl+O), every block renders in full; pressing Ctrl+O again restores summaries. pi-style only *reads* Pi's flag — it never calls `setExpanded` and never mutates Pi's expansion state.

### State

- A **turn registry** keyed by `toolCallId` (leader id, per-tool counts, total elapsed, failed count), populated by the app layer from the session snapshot at `turn_end`/`session_tree`, mirroring the batch and `bashTreeStates` registries, reset on session boundaries.
- **`turnEnded` is derived from session content** (the turn's message completed and a subsequent message or session end exists) — not from a runtime `turn_end` event flag — so scroll-back and session resume render identically. The renderer remains a pure function of content plus Pi's own `expanded` state.
- Summary counts/elapsed are computed when the turn is finalized; no render-time I/O, no filesystem/process work (TOOL-007 holds).

### Configuration

- New leaf `tools.collapseAfterTurn: "off" | "on"` (default `"on"`).
- Preset mapping: `default`/`compact`/`full`/`ascii` → `on`; `minimal`/`native` → `off`.
- Same precedence ladder, normalization-safe fallback, and `/pi-style set` support as every other leaf; `/pi-style doctor` reports the effective value.

### Compatibility

- **No new Pi-core patch identity.** The feature extends the already-certified boxed renderer surface (Tier C, exact Pi 0.83.0/0.84.0 subset). Unsupported host shapes disable only the affected surface per ADR 0004, with native fallback intact.
- Pi's expansion state and keybinding remain untouched; the `Ctrl+O for more` footer vocabulary is reused as the summary line's hint.

## Alternatives considered

### Per-turn expansion via `pi.registerShortcut`

Rejected for v1. The handler would have to target "the most recently collapsed turn" because Pi has no per-block focus model; that introduces a new keybinding surface (binding ownership, conflicts, keybinding.json id contract) for no demonstrated need. A v2 refinement if per-turn expand is requested.

### Folding by mutating Pi's per-block `setExpanded`

Rejected. Pi's `expanded` flag is Pi's own state machine (global toggle, persisted per component, resets on restart); writing it from the extension would fight Pi's status line (`Tool output: expanded/collapsed`), race with user toggles, and change behavior of surfaces pi-style does not own.

### Collapse from a runtime `turn_end` flag only

Rejected. Module-level flags reset when Pi restarts with a saved session, so history would render expanded after resume — inconsistent with the requirement that scroll-back and resume render collapsed.

### Summarizing `user_bash` blocks

Rejected. The user's own `!command` executions are scarce, intentional, and owned by a different component; keeping them visible preserves user agency over their own actions.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- the feed compacts to one line per finished turn while the final answer stays put;
- zero new surface, keybinding, or fingerprint — the mechanism and vocabulary already exist (batch panels, `Ctrl+O for more`);
- deterministic by construction: the same session content renders the same way in the live feed, scroll-back, and after resume.

### Costs

- assistant text between tool blocks remains in place (pi-style cannot remove Pi-owned text items), so a collapsed turn may leave scattered text chunks;
- one layout shift when summaries replace boxes at turn end (mitigated by applying through the existing deferred scheduler pass);
- the turn registry must be rebuilt from the session snapshot on resume and cleared on session boundaries;
- the test matrix grows (registry unit tests, summary render snapshots, resume determinism, expand override).

## Validation implications

- Unit tests (`test/unit/`): turn grouping and leader selection from synthetic session trees; per-tool counts and elapsed totals; error/partial exclusion; registry rebuild on resume; `collapseAfterTurn` normalization and preset mapping.
- Render tests (`test/render/`): summary line formats (Nerd/Unicode/ASCII/no-color), zero-line members, leader rendering, `expanded` override, error-block preservation, `user_bash` untouched.
- Lifecycle/e2e tests (`test/e2e/`): `turn_end` → deferred collapse; scroll-back consistency; reload and session-boundary resets; Ctrl+O expand/restore round-trip.
- Requirement mapping: new `SUM-001`–`SUM-005` in `docs/ui/MESSAGES-AND-TOOLS.md`; existing `TOOL-001`–`TOOL-007` remain in force.
- Compatibility: certified boxed renderer surface unchanged; no new fingerprint; unsupported shapes fall back per ADR 0004.
